# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-using-TensorFlow
This project demonstrates building a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes a simple model with one hidden layer, optimized via backpropagation. The training process is validated with a test set, and accuracy/loss visualizations are provided for performance insights.
